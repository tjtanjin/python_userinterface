### Introduction
Python User Interface is an adapted personalised version of an user interface that I created during my internship with [TOFFS Technologies](https://www.toffstech.com/en/home). Together with [Text Identifier](https://github.com/tjtanjin/text_identifier), it sped up my workflow and allowed for non-technical users to use my testing tool easily as well. For the purpose of generalising this interface/demonstration, the username and password have been hardcoded but please be advised that this is an absolute bad practice.

### Features
This generalised interface contains a login screen and menu sidecreen. All the actions/events have been removed after adapting this to be a personal code so no work-sensitive information is present in this repository. The code however, is styled such that you may easily add your own actions/events.

### Technologies
